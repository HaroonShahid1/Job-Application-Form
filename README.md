# Job Application Form Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a comprehensive job application form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form captures essential information from applicants and provides features for data validation, submission handling, and data visualization.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the job application form.
- `jobapp.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the form and creating a visually appealing user interface.
- `jobapp.js`: The JavaScript file that contains logic for form validation, data handling, and the transformation of submitted data into a table.
